# Systemic oppression and after-effects.
#### *A manifesto from the smokers of BuildNext.*


As smokers, we recognize the threat it poses to our health and the ones that are around us. We would like to appreciate the BuildNext corporate and the HR department for publishing such a circular in an effort to uplift the quality of life for those who practice smoking. This grand gesture is a giant leap in compassion towards the smokers at first glance. It is the decisive intervention of HR coupled with a strategically organized BuildNext Corporate that makes smoke-free workplace policy a reality. Emphasis on the HR department's capability for smoothly rolling out the policy and helping the employees transition into new ways of life around the company.

- #### **However, as employees and as citizens of the biggest democracy in the world, we are forced to question certain long term intentions behind the newly constructed policy**


> Smoke-Free Workplace Policy

> Highlights:

> 1.All employees will be smoke free during the time they work in office: This policy restricts smoking & the smell of smoke or other tobacco products on employees while they are inside BuildNext office premises.

> 2.Smoking is prohibited in all areas of the BuildNext office building without exception. This includes common work areas, conference and meeting rooms, hallways, the lunchrooms, stairs, restrooms, terrace and all other enclosed facilities. 

> 3.Employees who violates the above will have to take compulsory leave for the day on Loss of pay. 


The first and the third highlights of the policy as we understand are direct violations of the fundamental rights provided by the constitution of India.

- #### Corporate is well within their rights to demand that smoking shall not be conducted on the premises that the company has access to. But they can not and should not think that they can control the activities of employees beyond the confinements of the office.


The smell of tobacco is not proven to be a harmful source of radiation. It is not a source of third-hand smoke. Therefore is absurd to plan to punish an employee for having the smell. In a society formed by the pillars of cooperation among its citizens, one does not object to the selection of deodorants or cosmetics even if causes unrest, as it's deemed as a basic human courtesy. 

- #### Therefore it is repulsive to us that certain members of HR and corporate do not keep basic human courtesy in mind while forming policies. We can not allow in this great democratic nation to stand by idle while policies are formed that curtail the demands of basic human courtesy.



 Upon thorough analysis of the third highlight of the policy, a more diabolical and sinister intent was revealed to us. The human resources department conveniently excludes the smoking status of an individual prior to employment. We believe that HR has illegally collected enough data over the years on the employees to target smokers. Smoking is a very serious addiction. Nicotine is the most addictive substance under the sun. It would be impossible for a smoker to quit because a new policy is formed. 

- #### Misusing a lethal combination of private information about the identity of the smokers and the nature of their addiction BuildNext Corporate and HR are targetting employees and exploiting their addiction to deny payment.

This move is strategized to maximize corporate profits, since they know beforehand that it would be impossible for certain employees to quit smoking HR and Corporate is expoliting the opportunity.

- #### Therefore logic dictates that this policy nothing but a ploy to defraud honest hard working human beings of their deserved salary.

This is a direct violation of Article 23 of the Indian Constitution. 

- #### This is a form of forced labor which means involuntary work without any remuneration. A person is compelled to work against his will without being paid for it.



- #### If the human resources department had the best interests of the employees in mind they would have allocated funds for the smokers to visit deaddiction centers which many are unable to afford because of their troubling financial situation.


But thankfully our Constitution protects us from such exploitation.
We must lodge a complaint to the Ministry of Labour and Employment. https://labour.gov.in/

#### We condemn this inhumane act and violation of basic rights by the HR  and urge that proper actions are taken against it to  restructure the department by keeping basic human courtesy and quality of life for the employees at center while forming policies.

*We call upon our fellow colleagues smokers and non-smokers alike to act by sending emails and lodging complaints. Unite to fight this abominable policy. Because this isn't simply targeted at a minority of employees but a larger sign of oppression from the highest levels of corporate. Harassment, suppressing opinions, denying basic rights and public humiliation. These are the after-effects not of the lingering smell of tobacco but that of lingering systemic oppression.*

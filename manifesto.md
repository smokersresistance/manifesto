# Corporate oppression and after-effects.
#### *A manifesto from the smokers of BuildNext.*


As smokers, we recognize the threat it poses to our health and the ones that are around us. We would like to appreciate the BuildNext corporate and the HR department for publishing such a circular in an effort to uplift the quality of life for those who practice smoking. This grand gesture is a giant leap in compassion towards the smokers at first glance. It is the decisive intervention of HR coupled with a strategically organized BuildNext Corporate is what makes smoke-free workplace policy a reality. Emphasis on the HR department's capability for smoothly rolling out the policy and helping the employees transition into new ways of life around the company.

- #### **However, as an employee and as citizens of the biggest democracy in the world, we are forced to question certain long term intentions behind the newly constructed policy**

Namely, the first and the third highlights of the policy as we understand is a direct violation of the fundamental rights provided by the constitution of India.

- #### Corporate is well within their rights to demand that smoking shall not be conducted on the premises that the company has access to. But they can not and should not think that they can control the activities of employees beyond the confinements of the office.


The smell of tobacco is not proven to be a harmful source of radiation, and it is not a source of third-hand smoke. It is absurd to demand the employee to not have the smell. In a society formed by the pillars of cooperation among its citizens, one does not object to the selection of deodorants or cosmetics even if causes unrest, as it's deemed as a basic human courtesy. 

- #### Therefore it is repulsive to us that certain members of HR and corporate do not keep basic human courtesy in mind while forming policies. We can not allow in this great democratic nation to stand by idle while policies are formed that curtail the demands of basic human courtesy.

 Upon thorough analysis of the third highlight of the policy, a more diabolical and sinister intent was revealed to us.The human resources department conveniently excludes the smoking status of an individual prior to employment. Further, we believe that HR has illegaly collected enough data over the years on the employees to target smokers. Smoking is a very serious addiction. Nicotine is the most addictive substance under the sun. It would be impossible for a smoker to quit because a new policy is formed. 

- #### Armed with a lethal combination of information about the identity of the smokers and the nature of their addiction BuildNext Corporate and HR are targetting employees and exploiting their addiction to deny payment.

We argue that this move is strategized to increase their profits as they know beforehand that it would be impossible for certain employees to quit smoking. This is a direct violation of Article 23 of the Indian Constitution. 

- #### This is a form of forced labor which means involuntary work without any remuneration. In other words, it can be said that a person is compelled to work against his will without being paid for it.

This would also extend to any employee who enters the premises with a lingering smell of tobacco.It is of our opinion that, if the human resources department had the best interests of the employees in mind they would have allocated funds for the smokers to visit deaddiction centers which many are unable to afford because of their troubling financial situation. This is a calculated move to harass smokers and make profits off of it. We have reason to believe that HR is also involved in publically shaming smokers too.

But thankfully our Constitution protects us from such exploitation.
We must lodge a complaint to the Ministry of Labour and Employment. https://labour.gov.in/

#### We condemn this inhumane act and violation of basic rights by the HR department and urge that proper actions are taken against it by restructuring the department by keeping basic human courtesy and quality of life for the employees while forming policies.

*We call upon our fellow colleague's smokers and non-smokers alike to act by sending emails and lodging complaints and unite to fight this abominable policy. Because this isnt simply targeted at smokers but a larger sign of opression from the hgihest levels of corporate. These are the after effects of not lingering smell of tobacco but that of linger systemic opression.
